"""SSRF-safe HTTP fetchers for outbound calls to user-supplied URLs.

Two guard levels are provided, since Loom's outbound calls fall into two
different trust models:

- ``safe_get``/``safe_post`` (strict, public-only): used for OAuth2/OIDC
  discovery ("well-known") documents and the token endpoints they advertise,
  since both are attacker-influenced (an MCP server or A2A agent
  registration supplies the well-known URL, and the discovery document
  supplies the token endpoint) and legitimate identity providers are always
  public internet-facing services. Every call is forced to HTTPS, resolved
  via DNS, and validated against private/loopback/link-local (including the
  169.254.169.254 cloud metadata address) and other non-public ranges.

- ``guarded_get``/``guarded_post`` (permissive, connection sinks): used for
  the actual MCP server / A2A agent connection targets
  (``endpoint_url``/``base_url``). Unlike OAuth infrastructure, reaching a
  private/VPC-internal address is a legitimate, documented use case here —
  the backend runs in private subnets specifically to support VPC-internal
  MCP servers and A2A agents, and HTTP (not just HTTPS) is a supported
  scheme for local/internal deployments. These guards therefore allow
  private (RFC 1918/RFC 4193) addresses through, but still always block the
  cloud metadata address, loopback, link-local, multicast, reserved, and
  unspecified addresses, since none of those are legitimate MCP/A2A targets.

Both levels resolve the hostname once and pin the connection to the
validated IP so a second DNS lookup at connect time can't rebind the
hostname to a different, disallowed address after the check has passed
(DNS rebinding). ``guarded_get``/``guarded_post`` additionally re-validate
every redirect hop before following it, since an initial target can pass
validation and then redirect to a disallowed address.

    ``safe_get``/``safe_post`` guarantee an OAuth2 well-known/token-endpoint
    fetch can't reach an internal or metadata address, but on their own they
    still allow *any* public HTTPS host. That's exactly the gap client-
    credentials (M2M) and on-behalf-of (OBO) token exchange can't tolerate:
    the well-known URL is supplied by whoever holds ``mcp:write``/
    ``a2a:write`` — a delegated-admin scope, not the platform's top trust
    level — and the discovery document it returns is equally attacker-
    influenced. Sending the resource's own ``client_secret`` (M2M) or, worse,
    the calling user's real access token (OBO) to whatever ``token_endpoint``
    that document names would hand either straight to an attacker-chosen
    public server.

    The resolved token endpoint must therefore also match a host this
    deployment already trusts as an identity provider: the platform's own
    federated-login IdP(s) (``IdentityProvider.issuer_url``) or one of the
    authorizers a ``security:write`` admin has registered
    (``AuthorizerConfig.discovery_url``). Both are populated only through
    admin UI flows gated by a higher-trust scope than ``mcp:write``/
    ``a2a:write``, so a resource admin alone can no longer redirect a token
    exchange to infrastructure they control. Registering a brand-new
    downstream IdP for a single MCP server/A2A agent now requires first
